# Week12TidyTuesday
I've taken it upon myself to clean and manipulate data from GitHub's Data Science Learning Community - specifically, Week 12 of the #TidyTuesday data project challenge, which covers text-data on words pulled from Amazon's annual reports. For this challenge, I've primarily used R; however, you will see bits of HTML at some point in my work.
